# Multiplayer_Blackjack
Main Repo found here: https://github.com/saltwater-io/CollegiateCards
This repo was made as a fresh start to the project. As the Main Repo currently is, it is a mess. For myself, at least, it was hard to follow some of the code without having to look up some function's or dependency's documentation.

Not all files were written or rewritten. After all, there is a main repo link.
I could not test code without resolving the issue I was experiencing.
